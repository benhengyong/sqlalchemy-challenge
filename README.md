# sqlalchemy-challenge

This repo contains a Resources folder, and two files named climate_starter.ipynb and app.py.

Climate_starter file contains code answering part 1 of the challenge analysis.
Analysis was undertaken to query the data files provided for the precipitation data and station data,
with the precipitation of last year plotted onto a bar chart, and the most-active station temperature data
plotted onto a histogram.

App.py contains code for the Flask and APi routes part of the challenge. Within the file
routes were generated that queries specified routes required such as the precipitation route, station route,
tobs routes, start route and start and end route.
